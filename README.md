### Notes
- The starter code is there to help, but you're free to use any language.
- Use `example.gph` to validate your Bayesian scoring algorithm, not your structure learning algorithm.

### Graph Plotting
Here are some resources for plotting graphs in Julia, Python, and MATLAB.
- Julia:
    - [`Graphs.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl/)
    - [`TikzGraphs.jl`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JuliaTeX/TikzGraphs.jl/blob/master/doc/TikzGraphs.ipynb)
    - [`GraphPlot.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphPlot.jl)
    - [`GraphRecipes.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/GraphRecipes.jl)
- Python:
    - [`NetworkX`](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/tutorial.html)
- MATLAB:
    - [`GraphPlot`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.graphics.chart.primitive.graphplot.html)

#### Julia Examples
##### TikzGraphs.jl
```julia
using Graphs  # for DiGraph and add_edge!
using TikzGraphs   # for TikZ plot output

# An example [Chvatal Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chv%C3%A1tal_graph)
g = smallgraph(:chvatal) 

# Create notional names for the nodes
node_names = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L"]

# Create TikZ plot with node labels
p = plot(g, node_names)

# Save as PDF (using TikzPictures)
using TikzPictures # to save TikZ as PDF
save(PDF("chvatal_tikz.pdf"), p)
```

##### GraphPlot.jl
```julia
using Graphs
using GraphPlot

g = smallgraph(:chvatal)
node_names = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L"]

p = gplot(g; nodelabel=node_names)

# Save using Compose
using Compose, Cairo, Fontconfig
draw(PDF("chvatal_graphplot.pdf", 16cm, 16cm), p)
```

#### GraphRecipes.jl
```julia
using Graphs
using Plots
using GraphRecipes


g = smallgraph(:chvatal)
node_names = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L"]

p = graphplot(g; names=node_names, node_size=0.2)

savefig(p, "chvatal_graphrecipes.pdf")
```
